Module 2: SLURM Timelimit Monitoring

Provides utilities to monitor remaining walltime and trigger checkpointing
before SLURM terminates the job.

1. Ensure get_remaining_time uses SLURM environment variables like scontrol show job_id to get accurate walltime.
2. Can use slurm job dependencies for chaining
3. Ensure logs from resubmitted jobs are organized and do not overwrite previous logs.
